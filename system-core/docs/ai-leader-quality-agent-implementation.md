2. Weighted overall score calculation
3. Issue identification based on configurable thresholds
4. Recommendation generation for improvement areas
5. Compliance validation against established standards

### Database Integration

The agent integrates with the governance database schema through:

#### Tables Used
- `governance_agents_registry`: Agent registration and status
- `quality_assurance_scores`: Quality score storage and tracking
- `governance_policies`: Quality threshold and policy management
- `performance_optimization_history`: Quality enforcement history
- `agent_performance_feedback`: Quality feedback collection

#### Memory Integration
Utilizes the unified memory patterns through:
- Quality score caching for trend analysis
- Historical data aggregation for pattern recognition
- Cross-agent quality correlation analysis
- Compliance status tracking and reporting

### Orchestration Integration

The agent follows the orchestration-first architecture:

1. **Registration**: Self-registers with the governance agents registry
2. **Event Subscription**: Subscribes to quality-related events
3. **Coordination**: Collaborates with efficiency and other governance agents
4. **Reporting**: Provides quality metrics to the orchestration system

### Quality Standards Enforcement

#### Thresholds
- **Critical**: < 60% quality score
- **High**: < 70% quality score
- **Medium**: < 80% quality score
- **Acceptable**: ≥ 80% quality score

#### Enforcement Actions
1. Warning notifications for threshold breaches
2. Automatic recommendations for improvement
3. Escalation to governance coordinators for critical issues
4. Compliance violation reporting and remediation

### Compliance Standards Support

The agent supports validation against multiple compliance frameworks:
- **ISO 9001**: Quality management systems
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **Accessibility**: WCAG and accessibility standards
- **Security**: Information security standards
- **Custom**: Organization-specific quality standards
