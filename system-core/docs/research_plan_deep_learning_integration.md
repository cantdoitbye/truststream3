# Deep Learning Pipeline Integration Patterns Research Plan

## Research Objective
Research advanced deep learning pipeline integration patterns suitable for production web applications, covering 6 core areas:

1. Model training and deployment workflows
2. Data pipeline architectures
3. MLOps best practices
4. Real-time inference systems
5. Model versioning and A/B testing
6. Integration with existing database and edge function architectures

## Research Strategy
This is a **Verification-Focused Task** - we need to gather comprehensive, authoritative information from multiple credible sources to provide production-ready guidance.
