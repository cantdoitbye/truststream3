// Five node types with categorical organization:
NodeType: USER | CONTENT | COMMUNITY | AGENT | INTERACTION | TRUST_SCORE
NodeCategory: GREEN (users) | BLUE (content) | PINK (communities) | 
              YELLOW (agents) | WHITE (system)
```

#### Relationship Management
- **Trust Flow Calculations**: Multi-hop trust propagation through relationship graphs
- **Network Health Metrics**: Density analysis, connectivity scoring, and performance tracking
- **Community Analysis**: Graph-based community health and growth pattern identification

The system calculates **network health** using a weighted formula: `(trust_score * 0.6) + (connectivity * 0.4)` with normalization for optimal performance assessment[7].
