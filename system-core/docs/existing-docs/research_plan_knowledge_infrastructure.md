# TrustStream Knowledge Infrastructure Analysis - Research Plan

## Objective
Analyze the current TrustStream knowledge infrastructure and agent capabilities, examining existing agent memory systems, knowledge storage mechanisms, and identifying gaps in agent-to-agent knowledge sharing.

## Task Classification

## Key Investigation Areas
1. **Agent Memory Architecture**: How do agents store and retrieve information?
2. **Knowledge Persistence**: What mechanisms ensure knowledge persists across sessions?
3. **Inter-Agent Communication**: How do agents share knowledge with each other?
4. **Knowledge Discovery**: How do agents find relevant existing knowledge?
5. **Knowledge Evolution**: How does the system handle knowledge updates and conflicts?
6. **Performance & Scalability**: What are the current system limitations?

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive analysis report: `docs/current_knowledge_infrastructure_analysis.md`
- Technical findings with code examples and database schema analysis
- Gap analysis with specific recommendations
- Implementation priority recommendations
