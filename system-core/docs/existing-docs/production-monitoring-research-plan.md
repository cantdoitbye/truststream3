# TrustStream v3.1.0 - Production Monitoring Infrastructure Assessment Plan

**Generated:** September 13, 2025  
**Version:** v3.1.0  
**Objective:** Evaluate monitoring and logging infrastructure for production readiness

## Research Scope

This assessment will evaluate 10 critical areas of monitoring and logging infrastructure:

1. Current monitoring setup (Supabase built-in vs external)
2. Application performance monitoring (APM)
3. Security event logging and SIEM capabilities
4. Error tracking and crash reporting
5. User behavior analytics
6. Infrastructure monitoring (database, CDN, APIs)
7. Alert systems and notification channels
8. Log retention and compliance requirements
9. Observability and debugging capabilities
10. Incident response and escalation procedures

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Analyze existing Supabase monitoring capabilities
