# Deployment Procedures

**SAFE DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOLS FOR AGENTIC ECOSYSTEM**

## Overview

This document defines standardized deployment procedures to ensure safe, reliable, and reversible deployments across all environments in the Agentic Ecosystem.

## Deployment Environments

### Environment Hierarchy
1. **Development** - Feature development and initial testing
2. **Staging** - Pre-production validation and integration testing
3. **Production** - Live user-facing environment

### Environment Specifications

| Environment | Purpose | Auto-Deploy | Approval Required | Rollback Time |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Development | Development & Testing | Yes | No | Immediate |
| Staging | Pre-production Validation | Yes | No | < 5 minutes |
| Production | Live System | Yes | Yes | < 10 minutes |

## Deployment Workflows

### 1. Development Deployment

**Trigger**: Push to feature/* or develop branch

```bash
# Automatic via Azure Pipeline
# Manual deployment if needed:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
npm run deploy:dev
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Smoke tests automatically executed
2. Basic functionality verification
3. Development team notification

### 2. Staging Deployment

**Trigger**: Push to develop branch

```bash
# Via Azure Pipeline
# Manual staging deployment:
./.azure/scripts/deployment-scripts.ps1 \
  -Environment "staging" \
  -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" \
  -ResourceGroupName "agentic-ecosystem-staging-rg"
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Full integration test suite
2. Performance testing
3. Security scanning
4. User acceptance testing (if required)
5. Stakeholder review

### 3. Production Deployment

**Trigger**: Push to main branch (with approval)

```bash
# Production deployment with canary strategy
./.azure/scripts/deployment-scripts.ps1 \
  -Environment "production" \
  -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" \
  -ResourceGroupName "agentic-ecosystem-production-rg"
```

**Deployment Strategy**: Canary Release (25% → 50% → 100%)

**Validation Steps**:
1. Pre-deployment health check
2. Canary deployment (25% traffic)
3. Health validation (5 minutes)
4. Gradual rollout (50% traffic)
5. Final health validation
6. Full deployment (100% traffic)
7. Post-deployment monitoring

## Component-Specific Deployment

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Check migration status
supabase db diff --schema public

# Apply migrations
supabase db push --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Verify migration
supabase db diff --schema public --linked
```

**Migration Safety Rules**:
- Always additive in production
- No data loss operations
- Rollback plan for schema changes
- Test on staging first
- Monitor performance impact

### Edge Functions Deployment

```bash
# Deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Deploy specific function
supabase functions deploy trust-scorer --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Verify deployment
curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/trust-scorer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "health_check"}'
```

**Function Deployment Validation**:
1. Health check successful
2. Response time within limits
3. Error rate < 1%
4. Integration tests passing

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Build production assets
cd agentic-ecosystem-phase1
npm run build

# Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
swa deploy ./dist --env production

# Verify deployment
curl -I https://your-production-url.azurestaticapps.net
```

**Frontend Validation**:
1. Build successful
2. Asset optimization verified
3. Critical user paths tested
4. Performance metrics within limits

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failure (3 consecutive failures)
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 200% baseline
- Critical service failure

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Emergency rollback
./.azure/scripts/rollback-scripts.ps1 \
  -Environment "production" \
  -RollbackTarget "previous-stable-version"

# Verify rollback
curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/production-monitoring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "health_check"}'
```

### Rollback Validation
1. All services healthy
2. Database integrity verified
3. User functionality restored
4. Performance metrics normal
5. Error rates normal

## Monitoring and Validation

### Pre-Deployment Health Check

```bash
# System health verification
curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/production-monitoring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "system_status"}'

# Database performance check
curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/database-scalability \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "health_check"}'
```

### Post-Deployment Validation

```bash
# Wait 2 minutes for stabilization
sleep 120

# Comprehensive health check
curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/production-monitoring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "performance_report", "time_window": "5m"}'

# Error rate check
curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/error-tracking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "check_error_alerts"}'
```

### Success Criteria
