# Incident Response Procedures

**CRITICAL PRODUCTION INCIDENT RESPONSE**

## Overview

This document outlines standardized procedures for responding to production incidents in the Agentic Ecosystem. These procedures ensure rapid response, minimal downtime, and effective resolution of critical issues.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

**CRITICAL (P0) - Immediate Response Required**
- Complete system outage
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach or compromise
- Payment processing failure
- GDPR compliance violation

**HIGH (P1) - Response within 15 minutes**
- Partial system outage affecting >50% users
- Performance degradation >200% normal response time
- Edge function failures
- Database connection issues
- Authentication system problems

**MEDIUM (P2) - Response within 1 hour**
- Feature-specific outages
- Performance degradation 100-200% normal
- Non-critical API failures
- Third-party integration issues

**LOW (P3) - Response within 4 hours**
- Minor UI issues
- Documentation problems
- Non-urgent feature requests
- Cosmetic bugs

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-5 minutes)

1. **Alert Acknowledgment**
   ```bash
   # Acknowledge alert in monitoring system
   curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/production-monitoring \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "acknowledge_alert", "alert_id": "ALERT_ID", "engineer": "YOUR_NAME"}'
   ```

2. **Immediate Assessment**
   - Check system health dashboard
   - Verify alert authenticity
   - Assess user impact scope
   - Determine severity level

3. **Initial Communication**
   ```bash
   # Create incident channel
   # Post initial status update
   # Notify stakeholders for P0/P1 incidents
   ```

### Phase 2: Investigation and Diagnosis (5-20 minutes)

1. **System Health Check**
   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive health check
   curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/production-monitoring \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "health_check"}'
   
   # Check database performance
   curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/database-scalability \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "health_check"}'
   ```

2. **Error Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check recent errors
   curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/error-tracking \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "get_error_analytics", "time_window": "1h"}'
   ```

3. **Performance Metrics Review**
   ```bash
   # Get performance report
   curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/production-monitoring \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "performance_report", "time_window": "1h"}'
   ```

4. **Log Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check Supabase logs
   supabase functions logs --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   
   # Check specific function logs
   supabase functions logs trust-scorer --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```

### Phase 3: Immediate Mitigation (20-45 minutes)

1. **Traffic Management**
   ```bash
   # Enable maintenance mode if necessary
   # Implement rate limiting
   # Route traffic to backup systems
   ```

2. **Service Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Restart failed services
   supabase functions deploy trust-scorer --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   
   # Rollback to previous version if needed
   ./.azure/scripts/rollback-scripts.ps1 -Environment production -RollbackTarget previous
   ```

3. **Database Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check connection pool
   curl -X POST https://etretluugvclmydzlfte.supabase.co/functions/v1/database-scalability \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "connection_pool_status"}'
   
   # Run database health diagnostics
   # Apply emergency database fixes if needed
   ```

### Phase 4: Full Resolution and Recovery (45+ minutes)

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify underlying cause
   - Document timeline of events
   - Assess contributing factors
   - Determine preventive measures

2. **Complete System Restoration**
