# AI Agent Enhancement Strategy Research Plan

## Objective
Analyze existing AI agent system (current 26.6% success rate) and design comprehensive enhancement strategy to achieve 100% success rate.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Current System Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Analyze test results and performance metrics from `tests/ai_agent_test_results.json`
- [x] 1.2 Examine existing AI Leader agents in `supabase/functions/ai-leader-*`
- [x] 1.3 Review agent architecture in `src/agents/`
- [x] 1.4 Study coordination systems in `src/orchestrator/`
- [x] 1.5 Identify performance bottlenecks and failure patterns

### Phase 2: Problem Identification
- [x] 2.1 Catalog agent coordination issues
- [x] 2.2 Analyze payload optimization opportunities
- [x] 2.3 Assess current reasoning capabilities limitations
- [x] 2.4 Evaluate error recovery mechanisms
- [x] 2.5 Review integration between AI Leader agents

### Phase 3: Solution Design
- [x] 3.1 Design improved agent coordination framework
- [x] 3.2 Develop payload optimization strategies
- [x] 3.3 Propose advanced reasoning capabilities integration
- [x] 3.4 Create error recovery and self-healing system design
- [x] 3.5 Define enhancement plan for existing 5 AI Leader agents

### Phase 4: Strategy Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Compile comprehensive enhancement strategy
- [x] 4.2 Document implementation roadmap
- [x] 4.3 Define success metrics and validation approach

## Expected Deliverable
`docs/ai_agent_enhancement_strategy.md` - Comprehensive strategy document targeting 100% success rate
